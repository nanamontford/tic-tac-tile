  To ensure harmony, the colours were directly based on those found in the tiles. Bright colours are often found in mosaics, both modern and ancient, so the choices reflected the theme. Each colour was tested for accessibility both with eachother and with black and white, which influenced the pairings. For example, the yellow was never directly paired with white, as it failed accessibility testing. However, colours like the dark blue stood out against the white, which influenced the choice to use this colour in the headings and main text.

  <br>Cinzel was used as the primary font. It was used for the main headers and the reset button text. This serif font was chosen for its resemblance to chiselled tablet typography found on ancient Greek and Roman stone tablets. This similarity is in keeping with the mosaic tile theme, as this art style is most commonly attributed to those historical cultures. Linden Hill, another serif font, was chosen for the lesser header and paragraphs for its harmony with Cinzel. Both fonts were sourced via Google Fonts.

  <summary>Accessibility</summary>
  ARIA labelling is used throughout to align with accessibility requirements. For example, each cell is labelled with a row number and placement (left, centre or right) so those with visual impairments can play the game. All buttons and links are appropriately labelled. If clicking a link will result in the opening of a new tab, this is also highlighted in the ARIA text.

## Testing 

## AI transparency 
<details>
  Microsoft Copilot automatic commit message generator in GitHub was used. However, all commits from VS Code were written by me with no input from AI. There is also no AI-generated code in this project, nor was it used for debugging, as this project was undertaken to challenge my front-end skills (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), so its use would have undermined this goal.
